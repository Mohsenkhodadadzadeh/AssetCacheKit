**A Swift package that provides a generic and efficient way to asynchronously load and cache assets in SwiftUI applications.**

## Overview
`AssetCacheKit` is designed to simplify asynchronous asset loading and caching in SwiftUI applications. It provides a generic solution for handling various asset types (e.g., images, PDFs, videos, etc.) with built-in support for placeholders, error handling, and seamless integration with SwiftUI views.

## Features
 - **Generic Asset Loading:** Supports loading any type of asset by implementing the `AssetLoader` protocol.
 - **Caching:** Leverages `URLCache` for optimized performance by caching loaded assets.
 - **Placeholder & Error Handling:** Provides a consistent approach to displaying placeholders while loading and managing errors.
 - **SwiftUI Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI views using the `AssetCacheKit` view.
 - **Asset Types Support:** Currently supports images and PDFs, with plans for SVG, Video, and MP3 support in the future.

## Benefits
 - **Improved Performance:** Caching reduces network requests and improves loading times.
 - **Simplified Code:** Streamlines asynchronous asset loading logic and error handling.
 - **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a smooth user experience by avoiding unnecessary UI stalls during loading in addition of avoids UI stalls with placeholder views and error handling during asset loading.

## Installation
Integrate `AssetCacheKit` into your project using Swift Package Manager (SPM):
1. In Xcode, navigate to File > Add Packages....
2. Search for Mohsenkhodadadzadeh/AssetCacheKit.
3. Select the package and add it to your project.

## Usage
**Loading Images**
```Swift
import AssetCacheKit
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
    
    AssetCacheKit(loader: CachedImageLoader(url: URL(string: "https://example.come/example.png")))
        { image in
            image
                .resizable()
                .scaledToFit()
        } placeholder: {
            ProgressView()
        } error: { error in
            Text("Error is \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `AssetCacheKit` is used to load an image from a URL. You provide a `CachedImageLoader` instance as the loader, a closure to build the content view with the loaded image, and a closure to display a placeholder during loading.

**Loading PDFs with CachedPDFLoader**
```Swift
import AssetCacheKit
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
    
        AssetCacheKit(loader: CachedPDFLoader(url: URL(string: "https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf")))
        { pdf in
            pdf
                .autoScale(true)               // Automatically scales the PDF to fit the view
                .displayMode(.twoUpContinuous) // Displays the PDF with two pages side by side and continuous scrolling
                .displayDirection(.vertical)   // Makes the PDF scroll vertically
        } placeholder: {
            Text("Loading...")
        } error: { err in
            Text("Error is: \(err)")
        }
    }
}
```

The CachedPDFLoader works similarly to the image loader but for PDF documents. It loads and caches the PDF file and displays it in a SwiftUI view. Here are some view modifiers you can apply:
 - **autoScale(true):** Automatically scales the PDF to fit the viewâ€™s dimensions.
 - **displayMode(_:):** Sets how the PDF pages are displayed (e.g., `.singlePage`, `.twoUpContinuous`).
 - **displayDirection(_:):** Specifies the scroll direction of the PDF pages (e.g., `.horizontal`, `.vertical`).
 
These modifiers allow for customization of how the PDF is presented and interacted with in your app.


## Custom Asset Loaders
For assets beyond images, create a custom type conforming to the `AssetLoader` protocol. This type defines the specific logic for fetching your desired asset type.
